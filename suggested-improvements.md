Here's a list of suggested improvements. I want us to try each one 1-by-1 and I will confirm with you whether I like it before moving on to the next one:

1. Make the page surfaces look like actual paper
   a) Subtle paper texture – a tiny repeating PNG/JPG overlaid with background-blend-mode:multiply on the .page-content. Even a 4×4-pixel noise tile instantly breaks the "flat beige rectangle" look. Use public/paper.png. ✅

b) Faded edges / vignettes – inner box-shadow (inset 0 0 40px rgba(0,0,0,.07)) or a radial-gradient mask so the center is brightest and edges darken slightly, mimicking the slight concave curve of a page. ✅

c) Minute color variation per sheet – alternate two slightly different off-whites (#fff8dc, #fdf5ce) so the left/right leaves aren't identical.

2. Sell the center gutter & page stack
   a) Gutter shadow – instead of a 1 px border, use a linear-gradient background on the .page container that darkens right at the center, giving the illusion of a fold. ✅

b) Edge striations (stack of pages) – on the outer edges only, a repeating-linear-gradient (to bottom, #e8dec9 0 2%, #fff0 2% 4%) can suggest dozens of paper edges. Works best if you offset it 2-3 px and blur slightly.

c) Slight Y-offset – lift the right page up by 2-3 px and drop the left page down the same amount. Real books rarely lie perfectly flat.

3. Add very small 3-D cues
   a) Perspective tilt – transform: perspective(1000px) rotateY(-2deg) on the left leaf and the opposite on the right. Keep the angle tiny so text is still readable.

b) Book “spine” element – a narrow div between pages, dark cloth texture, maybe with two thin gold rules. Lets you ditch the current borders altogether.

c) Light source consistency – pick a direction (top-left, say) and ensure drop shadows on circles, text emboss, page curl, etc. all agree.

4. Round the top & bottom like real signatures
   a) Pure border-radius won’t look like the image you sent (which curves outward). Use one of:

b) Clip-path: clip-path: ellipse(100% 95% at 50% -10%) on ::before to fake the convex curve.

c) SVG mask: Embed an inline <svg> mask once and reference it in CSS for perfect smooth arcs. More control than pseudo-elements.

5. Interaction candy (only if you care)
   a) Page-flip animation—CSS keyframes for a quick 25° rotateY + shadow sweep when user hits › or ‹. You don’t need a heavy library unless you want drag-to-turn.

b) Mouse-over page curl – on hover, show a tiny top-right corner curl (transform-origin: 100% 0) to hint interactivity.

c) Sound – soft “fwoop” page-turn audio on click (keep it subtle and respect prefers-reduced-motion).

6. Decorative bookish details
   a) Running headers with the couple’s initials.

b) Page numbers in a classic face (Garamond, Baskerville) at the outer corners.

c) Drop-cap initial on the first paragraph using ::first-letter.

d) Thin rules above/below headers in #8B4513 to match your circle stroke.

7. Go full cover-and-spine
   a) Wrap the whole thing in two extra divs: .hard-cover-left and .hard-cover-right, each a few px wider than the pages, darker (#8B4513) with heavier box-shadow. When viewport is narrow, hide the right cover and show the book half-open, single-page view.
